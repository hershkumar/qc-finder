This function takes in a circuit composed of CNOTS, T, T^2, T^3,... T^7, and returns a circuit with

we have a function that converts a given circuit to a phase polynomial representation.
We can iterate through the circuit gate by gate, and keep track of a couple things
we have a matrix that represents the action of the circuit so far, and we can update that gate by gate
to keep track of the coefficients of the phase polynomial, we use a dict
the dict is keyed by the function that the phase is being applied to, which is a list
the values will just be a coefficient, which we mod by 8.
